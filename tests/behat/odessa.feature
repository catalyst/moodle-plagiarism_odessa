Feature: behat tests
  In order to have acceptance tests
  As a developer
  I need to be able to run behat tests

  (this is just an example to ensure behat is working)

  Scenario: I run a test
    Given I am on homepage
    When I use a customised odessa step
    Then I should not see "Fatal error, the world has ended."
